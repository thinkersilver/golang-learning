# Learning Go

The best way to learn a language is by programming in it. This repository contains data structures and algorithms reimplemented in Go. It also will contain code snippets which are required by other applications that being written in Go.
I have found the following tutorials helpful. 
 - insert -> go lang tour 
 - insert -> newstack go article 
 
 
## TODO
 * reorganise code to follow golang's project structure
 * add the minimal set of language features required to code algorithms
 * add a section for applications. E.g using a btree for storing an index.
